# Tuna-Canning Process and Quality Control 
Explains how canned tuna is made and how its quality is controlled , describes the main steps : starting from receiving the fresh fish, cooking, cleaning, filling.the cans, sealing, sterilizing, and storing . Also shows how temperature and hygiene are monitored to ensure the final product is safe and of good quality.

## Raw Material
**Type of fish:** Skipjack tuna  
**Reception temperature:** ≤ 4°C  
**Inspection criteria:** Odor, color, texture, eyes clarity, and presence of spoilage signs.

## Main Processing Steps

1. **Reception of raw fish**  
   The tuna is received in refrigerated trucks. Temperature and freshness are checked.  
   *Critical control point 1 (CCP1) : Temperature ≤ 4°C to prevent bacterial growth.*

2. **Cooking (steam pre-cooking)**  
   The fish is cooked with steam to make skin and bones removal easier and reduce the microbial load.  
   Temperature: 100°C for 45–60 min.

3. **Cleaning and cutting**  
   Skin, bones, and dark tissues are removed. The meat is then cut into pieces suitable for filling.

4. **Filling and adding liquid medium**  
   Pieces of tuna are placed in metal cans. Oil, brine, or water is added depending on the recipe.

5. **Sealing (hermetic closure)**  
   The cans are sealed using a vacuum seamer to avoid air infiltration.  
   *CCP2: Proper sealing to prevent recontamination.*

6. **Sterilization (retorting)**  
   This is the most critical step. The cans are sterilized at 115–121°C for 60–90 minutes.  
   *CCP3: Time–temperature control to destroy *Clostridium botulinum* spores.*

7. **Cooling**  
   The cans are rapidly cooled with clean water to prevent overcooking and preserve texture.

8. **Labeling and storage**  
   After drying, cans are labeled and stored in a dry, ventilated place at room temperature.

## Quality Control Tests

| Type of test | Parameters | Objective |
|---------------|-------------|------------|
| **Physico-chemical** | pH, salt content, oil ratio, drained weight | Ensure standard compliance |
| **Microbiological** | Absence of *Salmonella*, *Clostridium botulinum* | Guarantee safety |
| **Sensory** | Color, texture, odor, flavor | Check consumer acceptability |
| **Packaging integrity** | Vacuum, seam quality | Ensure no leakage or recontamination |

## HACCP Critical Points

| Step | Hazard | CCP | Control Measure |
|------|---------|-----|-----------------|
| Reception | Growth of pathogens | CCP1 | Temperature ≤ 4°C |
| Sealing | Recontamination | CCP2 | Vacuum and seam check |
| Sterilization | Survival of spores | CCP3 | Time & Temp monitoring |
